# Configuration for your custom commands
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configurations details and description for a command (see the examples below to understand exactly what it does and how to use it)
#   - (mandatory) aliases (list) : all the aliases the player can type to use your command. The first alias of the list is the one that will be used in display texts (for example, help).
#   - (mandatory) arguments (config section) : you'll add the arguments patterns you want. If you don't want the player to be able to enter arguments, you'll add a simple arguments object with an empty pattern.
# And that's all for the command itself. If you don't specify any arguments nobody will be able to perform the command, even with no arguments. See below for examples.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration details and description for arguments (see the example below to understand exactly what it does and how to use it)
#   - (mandatory) pattern (text) : the pattern for the command (see just below for explanations, 'Arguments patterns')
#   - (mandatory) description (text) : a description of the command (display use only)
#   - (optional) permission (text) : a permission required to use the command
#   - (optional) worlds (list) : optional, if you specify this, the arguments will only work in those worlds
#   - (mandatory) perform (section) : a list of actions (see details below) that will be executed when the player runs the argument
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Arguments patterns
# This is very important to understand, and it's easier than it looks.
# A pattern is a text, between ''. It can be from an empty string (so the command can be performed with no arguments entered) to a complex pattern with default values.
#
# Every word of a pattern can be :
#   - any word : the player will have to type the exact word (case doesn't matter though)
#   - a number : [integer] (the player can type any integer he wants)
#   - a decimal number : [double] (the player can type any double he wants)
#   - a player : [player] (the player can type any player name he wants)
#   - an online player : [player-online] (the player can type any online player name he wants)
#   - a string : [string] (the player can type any word)
#   - a sized string : [string:{min}:{max}] (the player can type any word within a range)
#   - a phrase : [phrase] (can be added at the end only) (the player can type any words he wants (technically infinite but minecraft limit the commands size so most likely not more than 50 words)
#
# It's important to distinguish the MODEL arguments (the ones that can be filled with anything or something specific, the ones between []) and the STRING arguments (the one that the player has to enter fully)
#
# STRING arguments caracteristics :
# - You can separate argument aliases with |
#   --> example of pattern with aliases : 'teleport|tp [player]' (the command can be used by typing either 'teleport [player]' or 'tp [player]'
# - You can NOT specify a default value with $
# - You can NOT specify a description in help with %
#
# MODEL argument notes :
# - You must specify a description with % to indicate what the argument is useful for. All _ will be replaced by spaces.
#   --> example of correct MODEL argument : 'teleport [player]%target_player' (the command will display in help as 'teleport [target player]')
# - You can specify a default value with $ so it'll mean that the argument is optional.
#   Optional arguments are not required to type and if they're not typed the default value is used instead.
#   You can NOT add required (non-optional) arguments after an optional argument.
#   --> example of pattern with optional argument : 'give [player] stone [integer]$64' (the command can be used by typing either 'give [player] stone [integer]' or 'give [player]' (in that second case 64 will
#       be used because the sender didn't specify that optional argument))
#   --> Please note that this example is simplified and cannot be used as it because the descriptions of MODEL arguments are missing.
